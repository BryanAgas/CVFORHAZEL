      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>A well rounded individual seeking to be your friend, your bestfriend, your lover, your boyfriend, and your husband in the near future.</p>
    <h2>Qualifications</h2>
      <h3><a href="C:\Users\lloyd\Desktop\My Personal Website training\HTML For Hazel\images\chef.jpeg">Chef</a></h3>
        <p>Can cook nice foods. Ask it and I'll cook it for you, if I don't know that particular reipe then I can learn it easily.
         Well, I love cooking and I'll definitely enjoy cooking for you.</p>
      <h3><a href="C:\Users\lloyd\Desktop\My Personal Website training\HTML For Hazel\images\diy.jpeg">D.I.Y.</a></h3>
        <p>I'm used to try fixing things. Well... I'm able to fix them sometimes ;) hehe. I'm hands on, name it, gardening, fixing house problems, painting etc.
        I used to have lunch with Mr. hammer and Mrs. nails when I was working as a carpenter back in the day. So if there's any problems in the house, it should be gone in no time.
        Not a mechanic though, I just break them even further at times I tried.</p>
      <h3><a href="C:\Users\lloyd\Desktop\My Personal Website training\HTML For Hazel\images\improvised.jpeg">Improviser</a></h3>
        <p>I love improvising! That's why most of the time I don't worry about things because when time comes or specific problem comes, solutions just appear from nowhere.
        But of course, I also like to plan things ahead of time and try to figure out a way what's the best solution for different scenarios.</p>
      <h3><a href="C:\Users\lloyd\Desktop\My Personal Website training\HTML For Hazel\images\skillful.jpeg">Skilled</a></h3>
        <p>My skillset is vast from diving down the rabbit hole to flying in the ocean. lol! I actually didn't know what to write on this one without me sounding like a dickhead. haha
        but I'm quite sure I have lots of life skillset that can be used whenever is neccessary. Survival skills for example ;).</p>
      <h3><a href="C:\Users\lloyd\Desktop\My Personal Website training\HTML For Hazel\images\sweet lover.jpeg">Sweet lover</a></h3>
        <p>hmmmm I may let you judge on this one but give it some more time, okay? (if it's not apparent yet)</p>
